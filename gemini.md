## Prompting Guide

Here are some tips for writing effective prompts for the Gemini CLI:

-   **Be specific**: The more specific you are in your prompt, the better the results will be. For example, instead of saying "add a new component," say "add a new React component called `MyComponent` that displays a button with the text 'Click me'."
-   **Provide context**: If you are working on an existing project, provide as much context as you can. This will help the Gemini CLI understand the project and generate more relevant code.
-   **Use the available tools**: The Gemini CLI has a number of tools that you can use to interact with your project. For example, you can use the `read_file` tool to read the contents of a file, the `write_file` tool to write to a file, and the `run_shell_command` tool to run a shell command.
-   **Iterate**: Don't be afraid to iterate on your prompts. If you don't get the results you want on the first try, try rephrasing your prompt or providing more context.
